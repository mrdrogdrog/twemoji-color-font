# Twemoji Color Font

This repository contains [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) as compiled COLR/CPAL font. I use [twemoji-colr from mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla/twemoji-colr) to create the font. For now I'm going to place only the compiled files into this repository. Maybe I'll change the structure some day so the font files will be created and published automatically. But there is a lot of work to do. Take a look at the issues for more information.

The latest version (14.1.2) uses a fork of twemoji because the original repository seems to be dead.
